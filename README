here is a list of unfinished feature.

-	heredoc
-	signals maybe
-	expansion
-	expansion in heredoc(create generic expansion function)
-	clean the files(not that important)
-	rewrite the built-ins


cases i'm not sure how to handle 

-	" double or single quote with a pipe|"
this gives an unclosed quote error since nbr_token only looks as far as a pipe or redirection/heredoc

-	export VAR1=$VAR2
	export VAR2=$VAR1
this would cause a circular expansion, export should recognize this on the second export and make both
empty values, in the first one it shouldn't expand because it is not recognized

unset seems to be a structure to store the env value of PWD and HOME
